![figma-scraper demo](./docs/demo.gif)

_Demo of step 2 ~ 4 running concurrently_

## Usage

This scraper is a combination of

1. Selenium scraper to crawl the Figma community files (Takes about 5 hours) - **You can skip this step and use our [latest data](./data/latest)**
2. Selenium automator to copy (duplicate) the file to your account (Takes about 3 days)
3. Figma File Archiver to download the File content as JSON (Takes about 5 hours)
4. And optionally, Figma Image Archiver to download the in-design images and layer baked as PNGs to your local machine (Takes about 6 days for top-frame layers, and about 1 month for all layers)

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# step 1. (Skip and use pre-crawled data if you want as mentioned above)
cd figma_archiver
scrapy crawl figma_spider --nolog -a target=popular
# this will output a output.popular.json file


# step 2. You'll need a new figma account since it copies about 30,00+ files to your drafts
# setup .env following the README at figma_copy
cd figma_copy
python3 main.py --file='../data/latest/index.json' --batch-size=10000
# this will output a community : your-file mapping under prgress/your-email@example.com.copies.json

# step 3. you can run this script with figma_copy in parallel
cd figma_archiver

# fetch files
python3 files.py -f ../figma_copy/progress/your-email@example.com.copies.json

# fetch images (this use the output directory from above step)
python3 images.py --src='./downloads/*.json'
```
