# Request your file to be indexed.

## Why would you want to file a indexing request manually?

- I cant wait for gridabot to index my file, I need it now!
- I can't see my file! it's been uploaded for a while now!

Sometimes gridabot can skip your file for technical reasons or because gridabot determined that your file is a duplicate. If you want a faster indexing, you can file a indexing request with PR.

## How to open a PR?

See [`0000000000000000000`](./0000000000000000000) for example

```bash
cd requests
cp template <your-community-file-id>
echo "<your-file-id>" > <your-community-file-url>
```

The file should look like this:

`your-file-id`

```txt
https://www.figma.com/community/file/1035203688168086460
```

Once PR is accepted and merged, your file will be indexed within 10 minutes.
